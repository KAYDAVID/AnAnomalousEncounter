# AnAnomalousEncounter
A text adventure game written in python in order to become more comfortable with the language. Followed this tutorial https://letstalkdata.com/2014/08/how-to-write-a-text-adventure-in-python/ with some of my own additions and alterations.

An excellent tutorial by Phillip Johnson. If you are looking to get into Python regardless of programming skill level this is a great place to start.
